## Why
For my project I'm working with a bacterial toxin that modifies TNTC motifs of ssDNA. Within a given genome, how many TNTC motifs are found? Are these motifs enriched within a  specific region of the genome, or perhaps within a certain gene?

This script aims to answer these questions.

### To do:
- [x] Find number of TNTC motifs in the human genome
- [ ] Map these motifs to genemap(correct terminology?)
- [ ] Add feature to ensure minimum motif str length is >=3
- [ ] Improve multiple subplot scaling for bar plot
